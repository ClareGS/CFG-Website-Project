        <p>
          A familiar and popular garden songbird whose numbers have declined markedly on farmland
          and in towns and cities. It's smaller and browner than a mistle thrush with smaller spotting.
          The sexes are similar with warm brown upper parts, pale buff underparts with dark speckles
          (which look like arrows pointing towards the head and are often arranged in lines) and a
          tinge of golden brown on the breast. They have relatively large eyes, as do Robins and other
           woodland ground feeding birds, and pale pink legs. The bill is brown in colour.
          The Song Thrush usually flies low, below tree top height, from bush to bush.
          Its habit of repeating song phrases distinguish it from singing blackbirds.

        <h3>What they eat:</h3>
        <p>
          The Song Thrush's diet includes worms, insects, berries and snails.
          The latest research suggests that they eat snails only when the ground has become baked
          or frozen and they cannot dig out worms, etc. They smash the snail's shell against an
          anvil (usually a rock). Blackbirds often steal the snail after the Song Thrush has cracked
          it open.
          Song Thrushes often feed under or close to cover.
