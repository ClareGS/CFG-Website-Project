          Small, cute and sociable
          The long-tailed tit is easily recognisable with its distinctive colouring, a tail that
          is longer than its body, and a bouncy flight. These cuties roam around together in family
          flocks that stay together all year-round.
          Gregarious and noisy residents, long-tailed tits are most usually noticed in small,
          excitable flocks of about 20 birds.
          Like most tits, they rove the woods and hedgerows, but are also seen on heaths and commons
          with suitable bushes.
          The shoulders and underparts are pinkish. The head has a white crown with black marks above
          the eyes and into the nape. They have red eye rings and a very small black bill. The black
          and white tail is very long, over half the length of the bird and the longest tail of any
          British bird in proportion to its body. The legs are black-brown.</p>
