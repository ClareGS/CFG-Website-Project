          With its noisy chattering, black-and-white plumage and long tail, there is nothing else
          quite like the magpie in the UK. The head, breast and back are black, the shoulders patches,
          belly and flanks are white. The black wings and tail, however, are a beautiful glossy,
          iridescent blue, green and purple. The bill and legs are blackWhen seen close-up its
          black plumage takes on an altogether more colourful hue with a purplish-blue iridescent
          sheen to the wing feathers and a green gloss to the tail.
          Magpies seem to be jacks of all trades - scavengers, predators and pest-destroyers,
          their challenging, almost arrogant attitude has won them few friends. Non-breeding birds
          will gather together in flocks.

        <h3>What they eat:</h3>
        <p>
          Absolutely anything. They have quite a varied diet in their original rural habitat - insects,
          rodents, carrion, eggs and nestlings, grain, berries and fruit.
          This variety carries over into the suburban garden where they will also eat allsorts of
          kitchen scraps and bird foods.
