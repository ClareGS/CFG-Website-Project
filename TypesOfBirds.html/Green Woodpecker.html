        <p>
          The green woodpecker is the largest of the three woodpeckers that breed in Britain.
          It has a heavy-looking body, short tail and a strong, long bill. They have an
          undulating flight and a loud, laughing call.
          The Green Woodpecker has green mantle and wings, yellowish rump and whitish underparts.
          The crown and nape are red. There is black marking around the white eye. The tail is
          blackish with green barring. The bill is grey-black and legs olive-grey.
          The male's black moustache has a red centre while the female's is all black.
          The juveniles are speckled with black on the underparts and head, and spotted with
          white on the mantle and coverts.
          As with other woodpeckers, the stiff tail feathers are used as a prop when it is
          clinging to a tree and its toes are specially arranged with two pointing forwards
          and two backwards.

        <h3>What they eat:</h3>
        <p>
          Ants, ants, and more ants. They are also often seen feeding on ants on the ground,
          e.g. garden lawns and pastures. They use their strong beak to dig into ant colonies
          and eat the inhabitants.
          They also feed on beetles and caterpillars, by extracting them from crevices in trees
          with their long sticky tongue.

        <h3>Natural habitats:</h3>
        <p>Woodland, Farmland, Grassland, Urban and suburban</p>
        <h3>Where to see them:</h3>
        <p>Green woodpeckers spend most of their time feeding on the ground. Look out for them
          on your garden lawn or in parks - short grass provides good feeding opportunities for
          them. Like other woodpeckers, these birds breed in holes they peck in dead wood. They
          can be seen in England, Wales and Scotland, though they're absent from the far north
          and west and Ireland.</p>
        <h3>When to see them:</h3>
        <p>Green Woodpeckers can be seen all year round.</p>
