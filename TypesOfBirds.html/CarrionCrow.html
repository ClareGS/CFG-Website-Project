          The all-black carrion crow is one of the cleverest, most adaptable of our birds.
          It is often quite fearless, although it can be wary of man. They are fairly solitary,
          usually found alone or in pairs, although they may form occasional flocks.
          While at first appearance its plumage is black, on closer inspection it has a green
          and purple iridescence.
          Carrion crows will come to gardens for food and although often cautious initially,
          they soon learn when it is safe, and will return repeatedly to take advantage of
          whatever is on offer.</p>
