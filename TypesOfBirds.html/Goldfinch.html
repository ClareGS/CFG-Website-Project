        <p>
          The delicate Goldfinch has beauty and charm in abundance.
          This small finch is strikingly colourful with its mixture of red, white and black on
          the head, golden brown body and bright yellow wing bars.
          Looking more closely, the lores and crown are black, the chin and forehead are red
          and the cheeks are white. The body is predominantly golden or tawny brown, but the
          belly and rump are white. The wings are mostly black with a large striking yellow band.
          The bill varies from pinkish to pale grey, and the legs are flesh coloured.
          Sociable, often breeding in loose colonies, they have a delightful liquid twittering
          song and call. Their long fine beaks allow them to extract otherwise inaccessible seeds
          from thistles and teasels. Increasingly they are visiting bird tables and feeders.
          In winter many UK goldfinches migrate as far south as Spain.

        <h3>What they eat:</h3>
        <p>
          Goldfinches are seed-eaters, feeding on various tree seeds, such as alder and birch,
          and on thistle, teasel and dandelion seeds, which it can obtain owing to its thin bill
          and light weight.
          Niger seed and teasels may attract them in gardens, especially if there are no fields
          nearby with thistles and dandelions, but they will also feed on sunflower hearts.
          Make sure you stock up, as they often go around in flocks and have large appetites!
