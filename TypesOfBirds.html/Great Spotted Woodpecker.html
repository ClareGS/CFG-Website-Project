        <p>
          It has a very distinctive bouncing flight, undulating as they completely fold their wings
          against the body between each series of several flaps, and spends most of its time
          clinging to tree trunks and branches, often trying to hide on the side away from the
          observer. Its presence is often announced by its loud call or by its distinctive spring
          'drumming' display. The head is black and white: black crown and nape, white forehead,
          cheeks and throat. The back, wings and tail are black, except for the large white
          shoulder patches and smaller white spots on the wings. The underparts are whitish-buff
          with red underneath the tail (undertail coverts). The bill is grey coloured, the legs
          are grey-green and the eye is red. Young birds have a distinctive red patch on the back
          of the head. As with other woodpeckers, the stiff tail feathers are used as a prop when
          it is clinging to a tree, and its toes are specially arranged with two pointing forwards
          and two backwards.

        <h3>What they eat:</h3>
        <p>
          Woodpeckers probe tree trunks for insects and larvae, but also feed on nuts and berries
          (in the winter). They grip the bark with their strong claws and, when probing the crevices
          or drilling holes, use their stiff tail feathers as a prop. In the summer, they will take
          bird eggs and nestlings from nests (including those in nest boxes, in to which they gain
          entry by increasing the size of the hole).
          The woodpecker's tongue is extremely long and sticky for extracting insects, such as ants,
          from their nest chambers and crevices. The tongue is so long that its muscles wrap around
          the rear of the skull and back to the upper mandible.
          Increasingly, Great Spotted Woodpeckers are feeding from peanut and suet feeders in gardens.

        <h3>Natural habitats:</h3>
        <p>Woodland, Urban and suburban</p>
        <h3>Where to see them:</h3>
        <p>Great spotted woodpeckers can be seen in woodlands, especially with mature broad-leaved
          trees, although mature conifers will support them. They can also be found in parks and
          large gardens. They will come to peanut feeders and bird tables. Not found in the far
          North of Scotland. Only a handful of pairs nest in Ireland, but numbers are increasing.
          Common in England and Wales.</p>
        <h3>When to see them:</h3>
        <p>Great spotted woodpeckers can be seen all year round.</p>
