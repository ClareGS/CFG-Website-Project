        The RSPB's Big Garden Birdwatch is the world's biggest bird survey and regularly attracts
        nearly half a million participants.
        <br><br>
        The records from people counting birds in their gardens provides a vital snapshot of the UK's
        birds each winter.
        <br><br>
        The <b>RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch 2019</b> will take place over the weekend of the 26th to
        28th January 2019.
        <br><br>
        To take part in the Big Garden Birdwatch simply spend an hour watching the birds in your garden
        or local park over the weekend.
        <br>
        Count the highest number of bird species you see at the same time. You can use pen and paper
        or the RSPB's online counting tool.
        <br>
        Don't count the total over the hour as you may get the same birds visiting more than once.
        Submit the results to The RSPB via their website.
        <br><br>
        Big Garden Birdwatch 2019 registration opens on the 12 December 2018.
