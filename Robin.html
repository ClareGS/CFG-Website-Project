        <h1>Robin</h1>
        <p>
          The gardener's friend
          The UK's favourite bird - with its bright red breast the robin is familiar throughout
          the year and especially at Christmas!
          The Robin is a plump bird with bright orange-red breast, face, throat and cheeks edged
          with grey, a white belly and olive-brown upper parts.
          Males and females look identical, and young birds have no red breast and are spotted
          with golden brown. Robins sing nearly all year round and despite their cute appearance,
          they are aggressively territorial and are quick to drive away intruders. Male and females
          both hold territories during winter.. They will sing at night next to street lights.
        </p>
        <h3>What they eat:</h3>
        <p>
          The Robin's diet is principally insects and worms, which it will normally catch by swooping,
          that is to say, snatching its prey on the ground after watching for movement from a perch
          above. They will also often follow a gardener that is digging the soil over for any easy
          pickings .
          They'll grab mealworms from a bird table or feeder, or snack on sunflower hearts. Fruit is
          another favourite.
          In the garden, the Robin has a sweet tooth and often takes cake, especially fruit cake,
          coconut cake and uncooked pastry.
