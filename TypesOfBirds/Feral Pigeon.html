        <h1>Feral Pigeon (Rock Dove)</h1>
        <p>
          The Feral Pigeon (also known as Domestic or Town Pigeon) is descended from the Rock Dove,
          and can have similar plumage, though there are also many mixes of black, browns, white and
          piebald. Feral Pigeons can be larger than Rock Doves owing to their mixed breeding.
          The adult Rock Dove is smaller than a Wood Pigeon. The underparts and upper parts are
          blue-grey, but the back is paler, and there is always a white patch on its rump. The neck
          is iridescent with green and purple. The wings are grey except for two distinct black
          wing-bars. The eyes and legs are red.
          Feral Pigeons have adopted ledges on buildings and other structures in our towns and
          cities whereas the Rock Dove uses cliffs.
          In urban areas where the numbers are allowed to increase they are sometimes considered
          a nuisance.

        <h3>Natural habitats:</h3>
        <p>Farmland, Marine and intertidal, Urban and suburban</p>
        <h3>Where to see them:</h3>
        <p>The wild Rock Dove is now found only along the north and west coasts of Scotland, on
          islands and on Northern Ireland coasts. Feral, or domestic, pigeons breed almost everywhere
          apart from upland areas, with the highest density in the most populated urban and suburban
          areas.</p>
        <h3>When to see them:</h3>
        <p>Feral Pigeons can be seen all year round.</p>
