        <h1>Blue Tit</h1>
        <p>
          At first glance the acrobatic and cheeky Blue Tit is a blue and yellow bird.
          A closer inspection reveals bright blue wings, tail and crown, yellow underparts,
          greenish back and mantle, white cheeks, and black eye stripe, bib and collar.
          They also have a black streak down the middle of the belly, and a white wing bar
          (across the coverts). The bill is black and the legs are a blue-grey.
          The sexes are similar, though the female is slightly paler.
          The juvenile birds are duller than the adults and have greener crown, wings and
          tail, and yellow cheeks.
          A colourful mix the blue tit one of our most attractive and most recognisable
          garden visitors. In winter, family flocks join up with other tits as they search for food.
          A garden with four or five blue tits at a feeder at any one time may be feeding 20 or more.

        <h3>What they eat:</h3>
        <p>
          Blue Tits feed mostly on insects, especially caterpillars, and seeds. In springtime they
          feed also on pollen, nectar and sap, and in the autumn on berries.
          In the garden they search among the plants and crevices for insects (e.g. aphids, beetles,
          and caterpillars) and spiders, but also take sunflower hearts or high energy seed from bird
          feeders, or peck at a suet food bar or peanuts.
          They are one of the most agile birds and happy to perch at odd angles.
          They will entertain for hours by hanging upside down from branches and feeders to grab
          sunflower seeds, peanuts and tasty fatty snacks. They are also opportunists and will
          often peck through foil milk bottle tops for the cream.
          Blue Tits, and other tits, also peck putty around windows, usually at winter time.
          Some may simply be hungry and attracted to the linseed oil in the putty, though it is
          thought more likely that they are simply searching for food.
