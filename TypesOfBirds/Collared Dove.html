        <h1>Collared Dove</h1>
        <p>
          The Collared Dove is small, slim dove with quite a long tail - it is much smaller than a
          Wood Pigeon.
          The plumage of this elegant dove is mostly a pale brown-grey but the breast is a pinkish
          buff colour. Adults can be distinguished from juveniles by the narrow black and white band
          round the back of the neck (which juveniles lack). They have deep red eyes and reddish feet.
          In flight, the length of its tail in proportion to its body can make its silhouette look
          like that of a Sparrowhawk, and sometimes other birds make the same mistake, giving alarm
          calls and dashing for cover.
          They are responsible for repetitive cooing songs and those twiggy nests on your satellite
          dish. Their monotonous cooing will be a familiar sound to many of you. Although you'll
          often see them on their own or in pairs, flocks may form where there is a lot of food
          available.

        <h3>What they eat:</h3>
        <p>
          The Collared Dove feeds mainly on cereal grain and small seeds on the ground, but will also
          eat berries in the autumn and, more rarely, caterpillars and aphids in the spring.
          In the garden, they will occasionally feed if seeds, grains or bread crumbs placed on the
          ground are on offer. They're nervous visitors to bird tables, they are a bit too big, but
          are increasingly managing to feed from hanging bird feeders, especially if seed trays are
          fitted.

        <h3>Where to see them:</h3>
        <p>Collared doves can be seen just about anywhere, but often around towns and villages.
          They're common visitors to gardens. But collared doves only came to the UK in the 1950s,
          after a rapid spread across Europe from the Middle East.</p>
