        <h1>Wood Pigeon (Rock Dove)</h1>
        <p>
          The UK's largest and commonest pigeon. The Wood Pigeon is generally grey with a pinkish
          breast and green, white and purple patch on the neck. The tail has a black tip and the
          wings have a prominent white patch. The eye is a bright yellow. The legs and bill are pink.
          Although shy in the countryside it can be tame and approachable in towns and cities. Its
          cooing call is a familiar sound in woodlands as is the loud clatter of its wings when it
          flies away.
          Wood Pigeons waddle when they walk, which adds to their general appearance of being
          overweight. In fact, the Wood Pigeon's feathers weigh more than its skeleton.

        <h3>What they eat:</h3>
        <p>
          Seeds and grains, and green shoots when they're out in the fields: crops like cabbages,
          sprouts, peas and grain. Also buds, shoots, seeds, nuts and berries. They will feed on
          almost anything that is placed on a bird table.
          They also drink a lot, mainly because they do not get sufficient moisture from their
          food, unlike birds that eat earthworms, etc. An interesting feature about how they drink
          is that they use their beak like a straw, whereas other birds scoop the water up and throw
          their heads back to let it flow down their throats.
